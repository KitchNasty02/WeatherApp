Notes for Mr. Pisu:

- run both concurrently in WeatherApp directory with "npm run dev" command
- run only client in WeatherApp/client with "cd client" and "npm start" 
- run only server in WeatherApp/server with "cd server" and "npm start"
- run only mongo server in WeatherApp/server with "cd server" and "npm run mongo"

For "npm run dev" to work
- make sure you have node, mongo, mongoose, etc installed
- will need to install wait-on ("npm install --save-dev wait-on") in root directory
- need to install concurrently ("npm install concurrently") in root directory
